# Adventure Pack

**WELCOME ADVENTURER!**

I've made my first game! It's simple, and it's a total roll of the dice as to how well you'll end up doing, there's not really any strategy involved, but you can definitely come out on top or on the bottom. You can have it all one minute and nothing the next.

## How to play

The game will introduce you to the options, but it's quite simple. When you start the game you will have 5 options and you cycle through these options until you pick 5 to quit or you die. Simple.

## Things to fix/change in the future

- In adventure you can select y, n or anything else and anything else still dumps. Just want y or n to work and anything else be "That's not an acceptable answer".

- silver is throwing up a warning as undefined in encounters.c but I'm not really sure why. It still compiles.

- You should only be able to have 1 of the purple and orange items. Otherwise you can end up with two "The One Rings", and it makes more sense that once you've got them, you can't get more.
